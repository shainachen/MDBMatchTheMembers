# Match The Members App

This app is a game that allows players to get to know the members of MDB. The game randomly generates images of members along
with four possible names of members, one of which matches the image. The player has five seconds to select the matching
name.

Selecting the correct name increases the score by one and moves on to the next image. Selecting the incorrect name or not
selecting any name within the five seconds results in moving on to the next image with no change to the score.

There is a statistics page that displays relevant game stats, including the longest streak of correct guesses and the results of the last three rounds.
